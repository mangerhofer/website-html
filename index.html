        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a student studying at BYU. My major is ACME, or Applied 
          Computational Mathematics Education, with Computer Science and 
          Music minors. I grew up in American Fork, UT. I served a mission 
          from July 2019 - February 2021, I served in the Alpine 
          German-Speaking Mission. I have 3 brothers and 4 sisters and I have 
          the most adorable neices (2) and nephews (4).
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time I love to read all sorts of books (but espcecially romance
          with adventure). I love playing the piano and the organ. When I'm doing things
          that don't need a ton of focus, I often like to put on comedy shows like 
          Brooklyn 99 or The Office in the background. In the summer I love going up to 
          my parent's cabin and exploring the woods with my siblings. I absolutely love 
          all things Disney and would live at Disney World if I could. One of my favorite 
          things to do is to explore nature and take pictures of things that look like 
          magical places.
